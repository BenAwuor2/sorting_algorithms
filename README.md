# README For The sorting_algorithms Repo

## Contributors: Ben Oketch
This project was written in the C Programming Language with the objective of understanding different sorting algorithms and how their time complexity may differ.

Each sorting algorithm had a corresponding file that contained the best, average, and worst case of the sorting algorithm's time complexity.
