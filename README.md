# README For The sorting_algorithms Repo

## Contributors: Ben Oketch
This project was written in the C Programming Language with the objective of understanding different sorting algorithms and how their time complexity may differ.

Each sorting algorithm had a corresponding file that contained the best, average, and worst case of the sorting algorithm's time complexity.

|File Name|Description|
|---|---|
|0-bubble_sort.c

'Corresponding File:'
0-O|This file contains the Bubble Sort algorithm. This method of sorting involves finding the largest item and moving it to the end of the array. The algorithm returns to the beginning and repeats this action multiple times until everything is sorted.|
